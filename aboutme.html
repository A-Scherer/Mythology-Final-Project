    <h1>Ancient Heroes</h1>
    <h2 style="color:Crimson;">From Odysseus to Achilles to Perseus, ancient Greek heroes were an abundance in stories. Many villages had smaller tales of a hero that came there once. Other tales were more widely spread and recognized.</h2>

<h1 style="color:Gold;">Ancient Greek Herooes have a very differnet origin story than most of our modern heroes do. </h1>

<h2 style="color:Gold;">For one, Ancient Greek heroes were almost never considered as a hero until they had died. These mortals had to transcend their morality in order to become a hero.</h2>

	<p> Ancient heroes were worshipped for their strengths. Homer tells the stories of both Achilles and Odysseus in his pieces The Iliad and The Odyssey. In both of these stories, the man hero demonstrated their strength through either victory in battle for Achilles or making a grand journey for Odysseus. </p>
	<p> These heroes could also be extremly brutal, as being a person with strong morals was not a requirement in Ancient Greece. At the end of the Odyssey, Odyseus slaughters the suitors that were trying to take his wife, and Achilles is a war hero who won glory through combat then dragged Hector's body around on a horse-drawn carriage. </p>
	<p> The Ancient Greeks worshipped heroes through rituals and sacrifices to them. From this we can gather that the Ancient Greeks valued strength and prowess in battle, and hoped that these heroes would lend them their strength. </p>
	<p> These heroes give us a good insight into the minds of the Ancient Greeks as stories about heroes show what the Greeks valued and what they should strive to be like.</p>
	<p> In comparison to the clear good and evil in modern hero stories, Ancient Greek heroes such as Achilles could be considered evil if the reader came from a place such as Troy.</p>
